## About

[Pixel art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art) is a form of digital art, created through the use of software, where images are edited on the pixel level. The aesthetic for this kind of graphics comes from 8-bit and 16-bit computers and video game consoles, in addition to other limited systems such as graphing calculators.

Creating or modifying pixel art characters or objects for video games is sometimes called spriting, a term that arose from the hobbyist community.
